# 🐍 Python Mini Projects Repository

This repository contains a collection of beginner to intermediate-level Python mini-projects. Each script focuses on a unique concept, algorithm, or GUI functionality to strengthen understanding of Python fundamentals and libraries.

## 📁 Project Structure

### Folders 📂 

- **Heredity.zip** - A genetic inheritance simulator that uses probability theory to estimate each person’s gene and trait likelihoods based on family data from a CSV file.
- **minesweeper.zip** - This is an interactive Minesweeper game powered by a custom AI agent that plays the game using logical inference. The AI deduces safe cells and mines based on previous moves and known information — simulating human-like reasoning.
- **Pagerank.zip** - This project implements the PageRank algorithm, originally developed by Google, to rank web pages based on the structure of their links. It includes two approaches: Sampling-based PageRank, & Iterative PageRank. The code is written in Python and includes a simple Tkinter-based GUI for user-friendly interaction.
- **crossword.zip** - A Python-based GUI application that generates crossword puzzles from a predefined grid structure and a list of words. Users can input their own grid design and custom word list to create personalized crossword puzzles.

### Python Scripts
- **DrawTurtle.py** – Turtle graphics-based drawing scripts. 
- **Linear Search.py** – Implements a basic linear search algorithm.
- **WiFi_Scanning.py** – Scans available WiFi networks using system-level commands (platform-dependent).
- **calc.py** – A simple calculator for basic arithmetic operations.
- **complement.py** – Finds the complement of a binary number.
- **countdown timer.py** – CLI-based countdown timer.
- **digital clock.py** – Displays a live digital clock using Tkinter.
- **leap year function.py** – Determines if a given year is a leap year.
- **morse_code_script.py** – Converts text to Morse code and vice versa.
- **paint.py** – A simple paint application built using Tkinter.
- **selection_sort.py** – Demonstrates the selection sort algorithm.
- **stopwatch.py** – A GUI stopwatch app using Tkinter.
- **tEditor.py** – A basic text editor with save/open functionality.
- **validator_credit_cards.py** – Validates credit card numbers (possibly using Luhn algorithm).
- **puzzle_of _harry_potter.py** -  A logic-based inference game that uses propositional logic to solve magical mysteries inspired by the Harry Potter universe.
- **puzzle_of_Knight_and_Knaves.py** - A GUI-based logic puzzle solver that uses propositional logic and model checking to determine the truth in Knights and Knaves puzzles.

## ✅ Requirements

-
 Python 3.x
- Libraries: `tkinter`, `os`, `time`, `datetime`, `subprocess`, `platform`, etc.
- Optional: `scapy` or `wifi` for scanning networks (requires admin privileges).

## 🚀 How to Run

To run any project:

```bash
python filename.py
For example:
python digital\ clock.py
```
## 🎯 Purpose
- **This repository is intended for:**

- Practicing core Python programming concepts
