🐍 Python Mini Projects Repository
This repository contains a collection of beginner to intermediate-level Python mini-projects. Each script focuses on a unique concept, algorithm, or GUI functionality to strengthen understanding of Python fundamentals and libraries.

📁 Project Structure
Folders
DrawTurtle/ – Turtle graphics-based drawing scripts.

Snake game/ – Classic snake game built using Python’s turtle or pygame.

Python Scripts
Linear Search.py – Implements a basic linear search algorithm.

WiFi_Scanning.py – Scans available WiFi networks using system-level commands (platform-dependent).

calc.py – A simple calculator for basic arithmetic operations.

complement.py – Finds the complement of a binary number.

countdown timer.py – CLI-based countdown timer.

digital clock.py – Displays a live digital clock using Tkinter.

leap year function.py – Determines if a given year is a leap year.

morse_code_script.py – Converts text to Morse code and vice versa.

paint.py – A simple paint application built using Tkinter.

selection_sort.py – Demonstrates the selection sort algorithm.

stopwatch.py – A GUI stopwatch app using Tkinter.

tEditor.py – A basic text editor with save/open functionality.

validator_credit_cards.py – Validates credit card numbers (possibly using Luhn algorithm).

✅ Requirements
Python 3.x

Libraries: tkinter, os, time, datetime, subprocess, platform, etc.

Optional: Scapy or Wi-Fi for scanning networks (requires administrative privileges).
